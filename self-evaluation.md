# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel pretty confident! It seems like a simple addition to what I learned today!
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It felt VERY strenuous..I definitely had some frustration and had to step away. I had a lot of both productive and unproductive struggles. I fought through both by re-centering myself and asking my classmates questions.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I feel like repetition with this whole concept will help me. I will dedicate sometime after class to go over it.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None! If I do...I will reach out on Slack! :)
